Working Group Discussion Lists
Each IETF working group maintains a general discussion mailing list where most of its work is conducted. Mail on the
working group mailing lists is expected to be technically relevant to the working groups supported by those lists.

Information on how to subscribe to an IETF working group mailing list, as well as the location of the mailing list
archives, can be found on the Web page for that working group. Access to the Web pages for all active IETF working
groups is available on the Active IETF Working Groups web page.

The archives for many working groups are housed at the IETF Secretariat. In those cases where the archives are housed
elsewhere, the Secretariat attempts to maintain duplicate sets of text archives, with the messages for each working
group stored in a separate subdirectory. The IETF Secretariat text archives are located at
ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf-mail-archive/.';
