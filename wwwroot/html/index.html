specification of Internet technology through discussion of technical issues, and it hosts discussions of IETF
direction, policy, and procedures. As this is the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed with
respect to topics discussed. Advertising, whether to solicit business or to promote employment opportunities, falls
well outside the range of acceptable topics, as do discussions of a personal nature.

The IETF discussion list is meant for initial discussion only. Discussions that fall within the area of any working
group list (or other well established list) should be moved to that more specific list as soon as this is pointed out,
unless the issue is one for which the working group needs wider input or direction.

In addition to the topics noted above, appropriate postings include:

Last Call discussions of proposed protocol actions
Discussion of technical issues that are candidates for IETF work, but do not yet have an appropriate e-mail venue
Discussion of IETF administrative policies
Questions and clarifications concerning IETF meetings
Email archives for the IETF discussion list are accessible via the Web.

Working Group Discussion Lists
Each IETF working group maintains a general discussion mailing list where most of its work is conducted. Mail on the
working group mailing lists is expected to be technically relevant to the working groups supported by those lists.

Information on how to subscribe to an IETF working group mailing list, as well as the location of the mailing list
archives, can be found on the Web page for that working group. Access to the Web pages for all active IETF working
groups is available on the Active IETF Working Groups web page.

The archives for many working groups are housed at the IETF Secretariat. In those cases where the archives are housed
elsewhere, the Secretariat attempts to maintain duplicate sets of text archives, with the messages for each working
group stored in a separate subdirectory. The IETF Secretariat text archives are located at
ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf-mail-archive/.

Several IETF Working Groups maintain http-based mailing list archives both at ietf.org and at other sites. Please visit
Web-based Working Group E-mail Archives for a list of these.

Architecture Discussion List
The architecture-discuss list serves as a technical discussion forum for all members of the IETF community that are
interested in larger architectural issues. It is meant to be an open discussion forum for all long and/or wide range
architectural concerns related to the Internet Architecture. In particular, it may be used to discuss and bring forth
different points of view on controversial architectural questions. Discussions that drill down and dwell on specifics
of individual protocols or technologies are to be discouraged, redirected to appropriate other fora, or re-cast to
discussions of broader implications for Internet architecture.

Meeting Discussion Lists
Each IETF meeting has an attendee discussion list where attendees can connect with each other regarding issues related
to the meeting.

for the meeting.

Please note that messages to the Secretariat regarding meeting issues that require the involvement of the Secretariat
or IAD - IETF Administrative Director should be sent to mtd@ietf.org for quick resolution.

Inappropriate Postings to Discussion Lists
Inappropriate postings to discussion lists include:

Unsolicited bulk e-mail
Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings, activities, or technical concerns

Unsolicited bulk e-mail
Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings, activities, or technical concerns
Unprofessional commentary, regardless of the general subject
The IETF Chair, the IETF Executive Director, or a sergeant-at-arms appointed by the Chair is empowered to restrict
posting by a person or of a thread as they deem appropriate to limit abuse. Complaints regarding their decisions should
be referred to the IAB. For more details, please see RFC 3005, "IETF Discussion List Charter."

direction, policy, and procedures. As this is the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed with
respect to topics discussed. Advertising, whether to solicit business or to promote employment opportunities, falls
well outside the range of acceptable topics, as do discussions of a personal nature.

The IETF discussion list is meant for initial discussion only. Discussions that fall within the area of any working
group list (or other well established list) should be moved to that more specific list as soon as this is pointed out,
unless the issue is one for which the working group needs wider input or direction.

In addition to the topics noted above, appropriate postings include:

Last Call discussions of proposed protocol actions
Discussion of technical issues that are candidates for IETF work, but do not yet have an appropriate e-mail venue
Discussion of IETF administrative policies
Questions and clarifications concerning IETF meetings

Working Group Discussion Lists
Each IETF working group maintains a general discussion mailing list where most of its work is conducted. Mail on the
working group mailing lists is expected to be technically relevant to the working groups supported by those lists.

Information on how to subscribe to an IETF working group mailing list, as well as the location of the mailing list
archives, can be found on the Web page for that working group. Access to the Web pages for all active IETF working
groups is available on the Active IETF Working Groups web page.

The archives for many working groups are housed at the IETF Secretariat. In those cases where the archives are housed
elsewhere, the Secretariat attempts to maintain duplicate sets of text archives, with the messages for each working
group stored in a separate subdirectory. The IETF Secretariat text archives are located at
ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf-mail-archive/.

Several IETF Working Groups maintain http-based mailing list archives both at ietf.org and at other sites. Please visit
Web-based Working Group E-mail Archives for a list of these.
